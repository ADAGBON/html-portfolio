             <li><h3>Shift by Sam Adeyemi</h3></li>
                
            
            <p>Amazing book by Dr Sam, he showed how to continually question the status quo and making massive shifts in every area of one's life. I was privileged to be in his Shift Conference in Lagos, Nigeria where the book was lunched and I bought it for NGN50,000. </p>

            <li><h3>The Covenant of Wealth by David Oyedepo</h3></li>

            <p>This is the first book in the Prosperity Series by Bishop David Oyedepo.
                May 2025 was declared The Month of Jehovah Jireh (Genesis 22:13–14, Philippians 4:19), so I chose to focus intentionally on Prosperity and Prayer.
                
                My goal for the month was to gain a clear understanding and working knowledge of the foundational principles of biblical prosperity and effective prayer. This book delivered exactly that.
                
                Here are two key takeaways for me:
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The Covenant is the most powerful force for supernatural provision. It doesn’t respect persons, status, or economic conditions. It is God’s timeless prosperity strategy for His children—sure, unshakable, and always producing results.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>When we make giving unto the Lord a lifestyle, we receive far more than we release—a divine open heaven that showers us with ideas, insight, and inspiration. These God-given ideas move us from one level of prosperity to the next, regardless of prevailing economic conditions. God opens new frontiers, teaches us how to profit, and empowers us to thrive—no matter what’s happening in the world around us</li>
                    <ul>

             <li><h3>AI Engineering by Chip Huyen</h3></li>  
                 <p>
                    In 2025, I made a bold decision to resign from my well-paying job to fully transition into the tech industry. While the role was prestigious, I wasn’t finding true fulfillment—and I strongly sensed that God was leading me toward something greater in the tech space.

                    I’ve always been deeply intrigued by Artificial Intelligence and its transformative potential. So, when I came across this book on LinkedIn, I was immediately drawn to it. The book breaks down, in simple yet profound terms, what AI systems are truly capable of, explores the latest trends in AI, and provides practical insights into building foundational models for AI systems.

                    One of the most valuable aspects of the book was its in-depth discussion on AI Agents—a topic that has become a major buzzword in 2025. It also clarified the key differences between AI Engineering and Software Engineering, helping me better understand where I want to position myself in this fast-evolving space.

            <li><h3>Parable of Dollar by Sam Adeyemi</h3></li>
                 <p>I’m currently reading this book, and one of the first powerful insights Sam Adeyemi shares is the true meaning behind the “talent” in Jesus’ Parable of the Talents. Contrary to popular interpretation, the talent wasn’t referring to natural gifts or inborn abilities—it was actually a form of currency in those days, much like the dollar today.

                    In essence, it was a parable about money—how to earn it, multiply it, and manage it wisely. The goal? To live in constant sufficiency and financial abundance, just as God intends..</p>

            <li><h3>Breaking Financial Hardship by David Oyedepo</h3></li>
                 <p>"The Covenant is the hammer that crushes the horns of hardship" one of my favourite quotes from the book. The books shows from scriptures how the earth is destined to burn like an oven and the covenant is the kingdom provision for the redeemed.
                    The covenant has no respect for any economic situation, it is active every nation of the earth to whosoever meets its demand. it has no respect for fasting and prayers too, until man's part is played, God is not commited.
                    <h4>What is the Covenant?</h4>
                    There is what is called, power to get wealth, power for wealth or divine ability for abudance, otherwise known as divine providence, which operates on the platform of the covenant.
                    Gen 8:22 is where the covenant of exemption from hardship took off

            <li><h3>Prayer Book by Emmanuel Iren</h3></li>
                 <p>This is my first book by the author and he showed that scriptures in 2Tim3:16 spoke about instruction which a synonym for it is tutelage or education.Meaning every child of God should be entrolled in 
                    the school of the Word. The particular subject in this school the book focuses on is Prayer. He also showed that prayer begins with initimacy hinged on what Jesus did on the cross to bring Man back in fellowship with God

            <li><h3>The Geek Way by Andrew Mcafee</h3></li>
                 <p>This book was the only book on technology i read this month. It spoke about the radical mindset that drives extraordinary results</p>
